# otag-service-development-kit
Open Text AppWorks service development kit (SDK)

The SDK provides access to the set of utility classes required to interact with an instance of an AppWorks Gateway from an AppWorks Service. It covers AppWorks dedicated service deployment API, which is a limited subset of the full AppWorks admin API.

We currently provide the facility for services to listen to service life-cycle events such as 'service installed', 'service upgraded' and 'service uninstalled'.

We also provide the facility for centralised configuration setting management. As AppWorks services are edited from the AppWork Gateway administration console, we provide the ability to respond to updates made here, and also expose creation and update end points for these settings.

Full documentation coming soon.
